# Openware AI Protocol (Agent to Agent - A2A)

## Overview

The Openware AI Protocol introduces a groundbreaking framework that combines epistemic logic with blockchain technology to create a decentralized AI agent ecosystem. Our key innovations include:

1. **Epistemic Logic-Based Validation**
   - Three-layer validation hierarchy for knowledge verification
   - Formal framework for agent knowledge evolution
   - Collective intelligence emergence through validator networks

2. **Blockchain-Native AI Agents**
   - AI Agents as NFTs with ERC-721 extensions
   - Verifiable state transitions with formal proofs
   - Secure capability management and evolution

3. **Validator Network Architecture**
   - Knowledge-based consensus mechanisms
   - Distributed validation with epistemic guarantees
   - Resource-optimized computation infrastructure
